# vmpc

Using cmake-gui to create a Visual Studio project, the whole thing should compile without problems and produce a standalone EXE, a VST2 and a VST3 plugin.

Make sure you have a C:/temp/ because vMPC won't run without it.

You will also need this repo to be put in the correct dir:
https://github.com/izzyreal/vmpc-home-dir

There's also an Unreal Engine 4 plugin in development here:
